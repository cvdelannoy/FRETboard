FRETboard helps you train algorithms for the detection of FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer events in a 
(semi-)supervised manner.

## Running
FRETboard is available as web application on [Heroku](https://fret-board.herokuapp.com/), or can be installed on your own 
system using pip:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cvdelannoy/poreTally.git
